Paper: [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of a basic U-Net architecture to generate images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using DDPM.

## File Descriptions
- **`UNET.py`**: Contains the implementation of the U-Net model.
- **`DDPM.py`**: Defines the architecture and processes of the DDPM framework.
- **`training.py`**: Script to train the model and save GIFs showcasing the denoising steps across various epochs.
